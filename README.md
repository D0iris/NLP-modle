A cutting-edge framework for training **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models with **FP8 mixed-precision computation**, optimized for efficiency, stability, and scalability. Designed for models like **DeepSeek-V3**, this framework achieves significant memory savings and accelerated training while maintaining numerical robustness.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Fine-Grained Quantization**
- **Tile/Block-wise FP8 Quantization**:  
  Split tensors into configurable blocks (e.g., `1×N_c` or `N_c×N_c`) to maximize FP8 dynamic range and minimize precision loss.
- **High-Precision Accumulation**:  
  Safeguard numerical stability with FP16/BF16 accumulation for critical operations.

### 🚀 **Memory and Compute Efficiency**
- **FP8 Activation Caching**: Reduce memory footprint by **30–40%** during MoE training.
- **BF16 Optimizer States**: Store optimizer states in BF16 for additional memory savings without compromising convergence.

### 🔧 **Robustness Enhancements**
- **Dynamic Scaling Strategies**: Automatically adjust quantization scales based on tensor statistics to handle outliers in activations and gradients.
- **Hardware Fallback Mechanism**: Seamlessly switch to BF16/FP16 on non-FP8-compatible GPUs (e.g., V100, T4).

### 🧩 **MoE-Specific Optimizations**
- **Expert-Centric Workflow**: Optimized dispatching logic for sparse expert computations.
- **Communication Overhead Reduction**: FP8-based gradient synchronization for distributed training.
